### Note about version 2.x.x

This is a total rewrite of the package. This version is more accurate and smoother.  And last, but not least, fewer bugs (grin).

### Installation

Run `apm install markdown-scroll-sync` or use the settings page to find the package and install it.

### Usage

There is no atom command or keybinding. There are no config settings.  Just open a markdown file, open the preview, and watch it work.
