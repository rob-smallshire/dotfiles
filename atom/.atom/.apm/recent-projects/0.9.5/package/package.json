See the License for the specific language governing permissions and limitations under the License.\n\n## Basic Usage\nOn Atom's startup, the package will list your 20 most recently opened projects.\n\nIt will then allow you to open one of them with a single click, instead of going through the menus and the directory explorer.\n\nYou can open it at any time using the command `recent-projects:open` (`ctrl-shift-O` on Windows and Linux, `cmd-shift-O` on Mac OS X) and navigate in your projects with your arrow keys.\n\n## Customization\nYou can put a PNG image named `.project-tile.png` at a project's root, and the package will display it instead of the default icon.\n\nThere is a setting if you prefer a text-only list.\n\n## Remote-FTP integration\nThis package can read [Remote-FTP](https://atom.io/packages/remote-ftp) config files. The remote path is displayed. If you want to auto connect your remote projects, there is a setting for that.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"recent-projects@0.9.5","_shasum":"f2c61a8c78a00d31595292f1ccdcfe84bae40e8e","_resolved":"file:../d-11607-64771-1cdonha/package.tgz","_from":"../d-11607-64771-1cdonha/package.tgz"}
