Questions arising from PUSH2-FMDomainmodel-050418-0852-1302.pdf

1. Is a single layout case sufficient for the spike?

2. Is the Space-Manager a single model element? How complex is it?
   I couldn't identify any internal structure.

3. I see GenericModule also has-a Space-Manager. Is this another
   instance of the Space-Manager which is associated with the root
   layout case, or is it a different class?


Questions arising from PUSH2-FMModules-050418-0851-1296.pdf

1. I couldn't directly correlate the names on this model with
   the names any the names in the Simple Structure diagram.
   Does SimpleStructure require all the complexity shown on the
   PUSH2-FMSimpleStructure-050418-0851-1298.pdf model?

2. Is the Decks submodel required for the prototype?

3. There is a Weight-Export node. Is this required for the Weight
   Estimation Exporter to function?

Questions arising from PUSH2-FMRooms-050418-0851-1300.pdf

1. How does this model relate to the overall domain model? I can't
   locate any of these three classes on the main domain model
   diagram.

Questions arising from PUSH2-FMFunctionalVolumes-050418-0851-1292.pdf

1. It appears that Functional Volume has a dependency on Deck. Does
   this imply that a deck model is required for a useful
   FunctionalVolume?

2. Is the placement algorithm required? (Placement Algorithm
   Properties Mixin)  Is this complex?


General

1. Will the container elements (e.g. EquipmentGroup, FunctionalVolumes)
   need to be explicitly modelled in ParaPy, or will the ParaPy
   part sequences suffice?  Do these collections need to model more
   than just cardinality constraints?

2. Some things I saw in the demo: Laydown areas? How are these
   modelled?

3. What does a minimum viable model look like?

   - Layout (root)
     - Space-Manager
     - Equipment
     - Topside-Layout
       - Generic-Module
         - Functional-Volume
           - Volume
         - SimpleStructure
           - *?  15?
       - Global-Layout-Element
         - Flare-Tower
         - Living Quarters
           - Helideck
           - Lifeboats
