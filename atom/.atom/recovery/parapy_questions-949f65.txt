It is not obvious from the documentation how to persist the model state to

2. Runtime reloading of functions/methods (Python/AML). Late binding.

3. Embedded REPL in the user interface for manipulation of the model.

4. Interactively change rules/formulas.

5. In-scene manipulation and picking - customisation thereof

6. Tracing dependencies - dependants and dependees.

7. Interactively adding objects.

8. Interactively deleting objects.

9. Documentation for the parapy.gui package.
